    "Shooter_Precision_00": "For your main weapon, I present the\nSplash-o-matic, a weapon fine-tuned\nfor highly accurate barrages!It may not have the ink spread or\nraw power of some weapons, but\nit more than makes up for it with\nrapid fire that is quite rapid indeed.Plus, when you can pin down an\nenemy with Burst Bombs, you don't\nneed as much power. Simply splatter\nthem at your leisure while they're\nmired in your ink.And with the Crab Tank special in\nyour back pocket, nothing can\nstand in your way! Try not to laugh\nmaniacally as you overpower the\nother team time and again.",
    "Maneuver_Short_00": "The Dapple Dualies are dualie-type\nweapons that have been obsessively\nengineered for optimum mobility!They're now lighter, allowing for\nfaster movement, but they\nhave less range. It's a trade-off.But you know what goes well with\nmobility? Even more mobility! That's\nwhere the Tacticooler special shines.Blitz forward with added speed from\nthe Tacticooler, and place Squid\nBeakons to help your teammates\nsecure forward positions to take\nadvantage of this set.It's not a hit-and-run strategy.\nIt's more like...run-hit-run-run-hit-\nhit-hit-run... You get the picture.",
    "Maneuver_Dual_00": "Do you know the Jet Squelcher?\nWould you like to have two of them?\nGood, because that's what Dualie\nSquelchers offer!If you don't know the Jet Squelcher,\nit features the ability to fire off\nextremely accurate and fairly rapid\nshots after executing a roll. And\nnow you have TWO of them!Meanwhile, you can sniff out enemies\nwith both the Wave Breaker special\nand your Splat Bombs. I call it the\n\"see it, splat it\" strategy.If you like to stick and move with\naccurate shots across a long\ndistance, I recommend you give\nthis loadout a try!",
    "Shooter_Normal_00": "The Splattershot is beloved for its\nease of handling and high potential.\nThis is the latest model of the\ngo-to weapon!Paired with Suction Bombs, you have\na wonderfully stable loadout that\nallows you to respond to whatever\nthe enemy throws at you.And let's not forget the Trizooka\nspecial. Let one off the leash at\nthe right moment, and I guarantee\nyour opponent won't forget!Is this setup a little basic? Yes!\nBasically one of the best setups you\ncan have! Master the fundamentals,\nand you'll become a force to be\nreckoned with.",
    "Shooter_Flash_00": "The Squeezer is a great choice for\nplayers who want flexibility. Pull the\ntrigger once, and you get a single\nhigh-powered shot.But holding down  changes\neverything! Suddenly the rate of\nfire goes up, and the Squeezer\ntransforms into an absolute\nturf-inking machine.Master both modes, and you'll barely\neven need the Splash Wall to shore\nup your defenses. But it's there for\nyou anyway!And with a Trizooka to tame far-off\nenemies, this set is built for flashy\nfighters who are comfortable being\nthe center of attention.",
    "Charger_Normal_00": "Simply put, the Splat Charger is a\ncharger-type weapon designed for\nlong-range offense.Its operation is standard\u2014hold down\n to charge up ink, then release\n to fire it all out at once, inking\na long path in an instant!Ah, but here's a key difference...the\nSplat Charger can actually hold its\ncharge for a short period while you\nswim. Tactically speaking, that's a\ngame-changing advantage!And with Splat Bombs to flush out\nhiding enemies and the Ink Vac to\nturn the tables on invaders, this set\nis impressively well-balanced.I recommend it for anyone who's\nlooking to eventually master the\ncharger category of weapons!",
    "Shooter_QuickMiddle_00": "The N-ZAP '85 is a shooter with\nexcellent ink efficiency and\nrapid-fire capability!And, um...its power is certainly...\nadequate. Sorry\u2014I hate to say\nanything negative, but this weapon\ndoesn't pack the biggest punch.But that's OK! It's fast enough to\nsend your enemies scrambling...and\nthat's when you hit 'em with the\nSuction Bombs.Fire up the Tacticooler to energize\nyour squad for a big push, and you've\ngot a nimble loadout that's built for\nteamwork. It's what makes the\ndream work!",
    "Roller_Hunter_00": "The Flingza Roller is a wild one.\nIts shape changes depending on\nwhether you swing it vertically\nor horizontally!I won't get too technical, but the\nautomatic centrifugal clutch allows\nfor light horizontal swings that go\nFLOOSH and heavier vertical swings\nthat are more like GLOMP!The bottom line is that you can\ncontrol the action. Use the vertical\nswing to lay down a path, then take\ndown nearby opponents with the quick\nstrike of a horizontal swing.While you're zipping around, you can\nalso lay down Ink Mines to help sniff\nout opponents and fire off some\nTenta Missiles for a one-two punch.If you're up to the challenge of\nsimply dominating a match, then\nyou should give this set a try!",
    "Maneuver_Normal_00": "Here we have the Splat Dualies, a\ndualie weapon born from the \"ink\nhard or get splatted trying\" culture\nof Turf War battles!These are dual-wielding, pistol-type\nweapons that\u2014let's be honest\u2014look\npretty sweet. But there's some real\nsubstance behind the style...The propulsive exhaust nozzles on\neach weapon allow you to perform\na high-speed Dodge Roll!As a trade-off, you won't be able to\nmove for a brief moment after\nexecuting this move. But during that\ntime, the two weapon sights overlap,\nincreasing your splatting power.Paired with Suction Bombs as your\nsub weapon, this loadout might SEEM\nas though it's lacking in power...\nthen BOOM. You realize you have\nthe Crab Tank. All hail Crab Tank!",
    "Shooter_TripleMiddle_00": "If you like the L-3 Nozzlenose but\nfind it a bit lacking in power...\nenter the H-3 Nozzlenose!The \"H\" probably stands for \"heavy,\"\nbut I like to think it stands for\n\"HAHAHAHA,\" which is the noise one\ntypically makes while firing it.Now, the fire rate suffers a bit\ncompared to lighter weapons, but\nwhen you can pinpoint your enemies\nwith a Point Sensor, you can make\neach shot count.And with a team all juiced up on\nenergy from your Tacticooler, you're\nready to laugh all the way to the\nwinner's circle.",
    "Spinner_Downpour_00": "Let me introduce you to a very\nspecial weapon\u2014this is called\nthe Ballpoint Splatling, and it has\na unique dual fire rate!Here's how it works. When you start\nfiring, the barrel spins super fast,\nspraying everything around you with\ntons of ink. It's great for covering\nturf quickly.But once the spin slows a bit, the\nweapon transforms into a long-range\nace! You can target faraway enemies\nwith shocking accuracy.And that's not all! Sorry\u2014I've been\nwatching infomercials. The Ballpoint\ncan be paused midfire to recharge.\nNot all splatlings can do that!Now, with all of these features, this\nweapon might take some getting used\nto, so I recommend taking it for a\ntest run on the firing range before\nheading straight into battle.In conjunction with Fizzy Bombs and\nthe Inkjet special, this loadout may\nnot be for beginners, but it's a\ntechnical wizard's dream come true.",
    "Roller_Heavy_00": "The Dynamo Roller is a roller I\ndesigned myself using a power\ngenerator for high strength and\nlong range!Now, I wasn't able to reduce the\nweight on the motor as much as I\nwould have liked, but this thing\ncan REALLY spill some ink, if I do\nsay so myself.Pair it with the Sprinkler sub, and\nyou can push forward to apply max\npressure to the other team.And what will your team be doing,\nyou ask? Why, relaxing and enjoying\nsweet, sugary sips from your\nTacticooler, of course. You'll be the\nmost popular teammate around!",
    "Charger_NormalScope_00": "The Splatterscope is a Splat Charger\nwith an added scope for more\neffective long-distance aiming.It's great for hitting far-off targets,\nbut your view is narrow while\ncharging, so be extra careful!Also, that fancy scope takes up\nspace, so something had to go.\nIn this case, we had to nix the\nability to store your charge.But hey, if you like to stay safe\nand shoot from afar, this could be\nthe charger for you!When you're not scoping and sniping,\nyou've also got Splat Bombs and the\nInk Vac at your disposal, so this is\na more balanced set than it would\nappear. Give it a try!",
    "Slosher_Strong_00": "The Slosher is one of the most\ntechnologically advanced weapons I\nhave had the privilege of demoing.I'm kidding! It's a bucket of ink!\nBut that doesn't mean it can't be\nabsolutely brutal in the right hands.See, slosher-type weapons are\nperfect for attacking enemies in\nelevated positions or hiding behind\nwalls. They think they're safe, and\nthen...SPLOOOSH!You can't rapid-fire a bucket, of\ncourse, but in conjunction with\nSplat Bombs, you can stop almost\nanyone in their tracks.And with the Triple Inkstrike special,\nyou have the ability to blindside the\nother team before moving in for the\nsplat. This loadout is a bucketload\nof fun!",
    "Slosher_Washtub_00": "The Explosher main is a reporpoised\nindustrial heater modified to fling\npiping-hot ink long distances!Its shots explode on contact with\nwalls and the ground, so it's handy\nfor hitting foes who like to hide!And with the Point Sensor sub, you\ncan reveal enemy positions to your\nallies, or queue 'em up for your own\nink bath, courtesy of the Explosher.For super-slippery customers who\nmight be slinking along in their own\nink, fire up the Ink Storm and watch\n'em scramble as they're revealed.With so many ways to direct the\naction, I recommend this loadout\nfor all aspiring team captains!",
    "Spinner_Serein_00": "The Nautilus 47 was the first\nsplatling to allow you to store your\ncharge while swimming in ink!It sounds like a small detail, but let\nme assure you...it's huge! It means\nyou can charge undetected until\nyou're ready to leap out and splat\nan unsuspecting opponent.Of course, this state-of-the-art\nweapon has a few other tricks up\nits sleeve as well...It can be paused midshot to charge.\nIt has a stabilizer to keep your aim\nsteady while you jump. And it makes\nan inkredible grilled cheese! Oh, I may\nhave dreamed the last one...Anyway, with the Point Sensor sub\nand Ink Storm special to help read\nopponent positions, this loadout can\nmake you feel like you're playing in\nCod Mode!",
    "Shelter_Normal_00": "Umbrellas help you stay dry, but\nSplat Brellas do that and more\u2014like\ncoat the battlefield and any enemies\nin your path with ink!Let me explain. You can spray ink\nnormally with . But if you HOLD\n, the brella will open like a shield!And if you hold  even longer,\nyou'll launch the brella itself.\nIt leaves a trail of ink, can damage\nenemies, and STILL protects you.\nIt's a triple threat!Speaking of triples, this set also\ncomes with the Triple Inkstrike and\nthe Sprinkler sub, so I guess you\ncould say it's got you covered.",
    "Shelter_Compact_00": "Of all the brella-type weapons, the\nUndercover Brella looks the most like\nan ordinary umbrella. And that's no\naccident\u2014the weapon was designed\nfor stealth splatting!Getting into the technical aspects,\nthe canopy-launching mechanism has\nbeen removed here to allow for rapid\nfire. The weapon can even be fired\nwhile the canopy is open!Back to stealth capabilities\u2014you can\nuse the Ink Mine sub weapon to help\nscope opponent positions before\nsneaking in for a splat they'll\nnever see coming.And if you're spotted? Throw all\nsubtlety out the window, fire up the\nReefslider, and ride boldly to victory!I recommend this set to all aspiring\nspies, especially those who know how\nto walk softly and carry a big\nshark-based motorcycle.",
    "Charger_Long_00": "With its pressurized polymer\nconstruction, the E-liter 4K has\na remarkably long range, even for\na charger!To get the most out of it, you can\nset Ink Mines for opponents who get\ntoo close, then use the Wave Breaker\nspecial to reveal those who are\nslinking around in the ink.Still, this set is all about long-range\naccuracy, and in the right hands, it\nwill definitely hit the target. I hope\nit goes to a good home!",
    "Shooter_Blaze_00": "The range and accuracy of the\nAerospray MG aren't anything to write\nhome about, but break out a pen and\nsome stationery for its rate of fire!And when you pair a nimble weapon\nlike that with Fizzy Bombs, it makes\nmovement a breeze. You can quickly\nlock down plenty of turf to help\nsupport your teammates.Of course, inking turf is the name\nof the game, but sometimes you\nneed a little extra OOMPH, and that's\nwhere the Reefslider special comes\nin. Ride it to glorious victory!This setup is ideal for players who\nlike to mix it up\u2014tactically pushing\nthe front line and waiting for the\nright moment to go big.",
    "Shooter_Heavy_00": "The .96 Gal is a shooter that hits\nhard and has a long range, courtesy\nof its large chamber and extended\nbarrel!This thing would be an absolute\ncheat code if it fired just a little\nfaster...but you can't have your\ncrab cake and eat it too. You have\nto make each shot count!Still, you can set up a Sprinkler to\nhelp secure your turf...and the\nInk Vac special doesn't suck. I mean,\nit DOES, but...you know what I mean!",
    "Brush_Normal_00": "The Octobrush has dense bristles\nthat fling a thick stream of ink with\neach slash. It's a heavier entry in the\nbrush weapon class, which is known\nfor being light and nimble.But even with those heavy brush\nstrokes, you won't be able to reach\neverywhere\u2014and that's where the\nSuction Bombs come in.Lastly, if you're up against enemies\nwith ranged weapons who just won't\nengage up close, you've got the\nZipcaster in your back pocket. Zip\non over and give 'em what for!This is a user-friendly loadout that's\neasy for beginner brushers but\ncapable enough for true artistes!",
    "Charger_Light_00": "The Bamboozler 14 Mk I is a tribute\nto a weapon used by the leader of\nthe famous Squidbeak Splatoon, but\nretooled for the battles of today!I've used bamboo in my version to\nremain faithful to the original design,\nbut as a trade-off, it can't store a\ncharged shot.Is it the most powerful charger?\nNo. Is it the most mobile charger?\nAlso no. But with \"good enough\"\npower and charging speed, I think\nthis is a compromise that WORKS.Plus, when you have Autobombs to\nsniff out enemy positions, you can\nput yourself in the perfect spot to\ncharge up and attack!For the coup de gr\u00e2ce, activate your\nKiller Wail 5.1 and take a moment to\npay tribute to the legendary leader\nwho inspired this weapon.",
    "Stringer_Short_00": "The REEF-LUX 450 is a lighter version\nof the Tri-Stringer that's a bit more\nuser-friendly for folks who are new\nto stringer-type weapons.Like most lightweight weapons, it\ndoesn't pack the biggest punch or\nrange\u2014no exploding charged shots\nhere\u2014but it does offer the ability\nto store a charge!This set comes with Curling Bombs\nto help you close the gap into enemy\nturf quickly, letting you take full\nadvantage of the nimble nature of\nyour main weapon.And when you want to make a big\nimpact in a hurry, don't forget about\nyour Tenta Missiles. You can make it\nrain missiles on opponents out of\nrange of the REEF-LUX.This is a highly mobile loadout that\nlets you fight with flexibility and still\ntake down powerhouse opponents.\nI hope you give it a try!",
    "Shooter_TripleQuick_00": "Why fire once when you can fire\nthree times? That's the question\nthat the L-3 Nozzlenose answers.\nOne pull of the trigger launches\nthree rapid shots.Now, don't get me wrong. This isn't\na full-auto weapon. Holding down \nis like pressing the \"close door\"\nbutton in an elevator\u2014it does\nabsolutely nothing!So you'll want to time your triple\nshots perfectly...and wait for the\nright moment to toss a Curling Bomb.\nOr, if a triple shot won't do the trick,\nthere's always the Crab Tank!So who's this set for? Just about\nanyone! It's so balanced that both\nthe freshest noobs and the crustiest\nveterans can find a use for it.",
    "Slosher_Diffusion_00": "The Tri-Slosher answers a question\nthat nobody asked, which is...\"Please\nlet me fling three giant buckets of ink\nat the same time.\"Hey, come to think of it, that's not\neven a question! Anyway, since the\nTri-Slosher offers a broader attack,\nthe inkpower is a bit less than your\nbasic Slosher.\nBut when you've got Toxic Mist to\nslow enemies down, it's barely even a\nproblem. Add in the Inkjet, and you're\npacking plenty of power. This is a set\nfor sloshing away with impunity!",
    "Shooter_Short_00": "With its wide muzzle, the\nSploosh-o-matic is well suited\nfor close-combat situations.And escorting you to those close-\ncombat situations is the Curling\nBomb! Let one loose, and it'll lay\ndown a proverbial red carpet to\nyour foes' feet.Combined with the Ultra Stamp's\nforward rush, you have one powerful\nsetup for players who love getting up\nclose and personal\u2014or who want to\nblaze a path forward for their allies.",
    "Shooter_Gravity_00": "The .52 Gal is a heavy hitter with\nan extra-large nozzle for shooting\nmassive amounts of ink.Of course, all that power comes at\nthe expense of fire rate...which is\nwhy you'll want the Splash Wall to\nhide behind while reloading.And if the other team is playing it\na little too safe, you've always got\nthe Killer Wail 5.1. Lock on and blast\n'em with lasers!So if you're the type to hang back\nand wait for just the right moment,\nthis loadout is for you.",
    "Blaster_Short_00": "The Luna Blaster may look cute, but\nits short-range exploding ink shots\npack a serious wallop.If you find that your enemies are\ndancing just outside that range,\ntoss a few Splat Bombs to keep 'em\non their toes.And for the ones sniping you from\nFAR away, fire up the Zipcaster,\nsneak behind 'em, and...well, you\nknow what to do from there.Really, this set is ideal for players\nwho want to read the terrain and\nreact to their opponents' moves.",
    "Maneuver_Stepper_00": "The Dark Tetra Dualies feature\nfour ink-ejecting nozzles that allow\nyou to execute up to four Dodge\nRolls in a row! Yes, I said FOUR!And because you can shoot while\nrolling, you'll be able to zip around\nstages with ease and roll your way\nto victory.This loadout also comes with\nAutobombs, which almost seems\nunfair. You can use those to chase\nyour opponents out of hiding spots,\nand then swoop in with the splat.And if they slip away? Fire up the\nReefslider and hunt 'em down, shark-\nstyle. I recommend this set for those\nwho want to set up their own pincer\nmoves and pressure the enemy!",
    "Blaster_Long_00": "The Range Blaster delays the\noxidization of ink, which extends\nthe range before it explodes.Let that sink in. It's SO COOL how\nit works! Of course, you lose a\nlittle fire rate, but that's OK when\nyou have Suction Bombs to flush\nout your opponents.And with the Wave Breaker at your\ndisposal to reveal their positions,\nit's almost like your enemies will\nhave nowhere to hide!I recommend this loadout to anyone\nwho fancies themselves a master\nof the hunt.",
    "Stringer_Normal_00": "I am so excited to share this new\nweapon tech with you. Behold the\nTri-Stringer\u2014a stringer-type weapon\nthat fires in three directions at once!Press  while standing or running,\nand the ink will fire horizontally.\nPress  while jumping for a shot\nthat's concentrated vertically. The\nflexibility is unparalleled!And that's not even the best part.\nYou can hold down  to charge a\nshot! The ink will fly farther AND\nexplode if it hits a wall or the floor.I could go on all day about stringers,\nbut I should mention that the Toxic\nMist sub is great for keeping enemies\nat bay, or at least slowing them down.And for enemies that you can't even\nreach with a charged shot, you've\ngot the Killer Wail 5.1 with supersonic\nrange at your disposal.I hope you'll give one of the new\nstringers a try!",
    "Saber_Lite_00": "The Splatana Wiper is part of an\nentirely new category of weapons\nknown as splatanas! These sword-\nlike slashers can fling ink through\nthe power of centrifugal force.To do a basic horizontal slash, just\npress . But you can also hold\n to unleash a vertical slash that\nwill really send some ink flying!On top of that, if you perform a\nvertical slash while tilting  a bit\nforward, you'll step forward with the\nattack, adding enough power to\nflatten most foes.Paired with the Torpedo sub, you can\nslash across the battlefield and level\nyour enemies with a single stroke.\nIt's almost too good!And I haven't even mentioned the\nUltra Stamp special yet. If the\nother team hasn't surrendered,\nthe Ultra Stamp is sure to make\n'em think twice.If you want to be among the first\ntrailblazers in the splatana-fighting\ngenre, this set is for you!",
    "Brush_Mini_00": "The Inkbrush is a super-light brush\nweapon that lets you ink your way\nforward with blistering speed!There's not much room for power\nwhen you're moving that fast, but\nyou can keep counterattacks at\nbay with plenty of Splat Bombs.Add the Killer Wail 5.1 to the mix,\nand you've got a combo that will\nconfuse and annoy your opponents\ninto submission!I can see it now... You blaze across\nbattle lines...toss a Splat Bomb, and\ntrigger the Killer Wail just in time to\nheadbang along as the clock runs out.\nWhew! That's inking outside the box!",
    "Charger_Keeper_00": "I debuted this weapon before, but I'm\nas proud as ever of the Goo Tuber, a\ncharger with the upgraded ability to\nstore your charge even longer!It offers high-pressure ink storage\nfor extended periods, allowing you to\nstay submerged while you wait for\nthe perfect shot!In exchange, it takes a bit longer to\ncharge, but this baby can even store\na partial charge, giving you the\nultimate in flexibility.For instance, while you use a Torpedo\nto reveal enemy positions, you can\nbe comfortably charging away in\na safe spot.Then, when you're ready to ink 'em\nup, zip to the most advantageous\nspot and snipe away! If you miss,\nyou have Tenta Missiles in your back\npocket to finish the job.If you want to take your strategy to\nthe next level by storing charges\nand taking advantage of each stage's\nunique terrain with your mobility,\nthis set is for you!",
    "Spinner_Hyper_00": "The Hydra Splatling is designed to\nimpose extreme pressure on your\nopponents' turf through superior\nfirepower.However, because the weapon takes\nso long to charge, it's definitely\na liability in close quarters.I recommend using your Autobombs\nto fend off incoming bogeys\u2014and\nthey can even help reveal far-off\nopponents who can be splatted from\nlong range!If anyone DOES make it past your\ndefenses, the unwelcome surprises\naren't over. This loadout allows you\nto greet them with a Booyah Bomb!\nMi casa is NOT su casa!I recommend this setup for all you\nhomebodies who want to set up\ncamp and never leave\u2014supporting\nyour team through long-range\nfirepower instead!"
